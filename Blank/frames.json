A defense-oriented version of the Genghis that was forgotten by time as they laid the groundwork for the Saladin. The HANNIBAL is the intermediary between the Genghis, first of the true Harrison frames, and its derivates. <br> Long-forgotten war stories speak of a bulky Genghis that roamed Hercynea, burning away any threat to squads. Likely the origin of the spark for the Saladin and the legend of the Fearkiller of the Interest War.",
